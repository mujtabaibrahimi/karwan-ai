Karwan AI is basically an AI employee that works for you nonstop. The name Karwan comes from the Dari and Pashto word for caravan, because a caravan never stops, it keeps moving no matter what. That is what this is.

Most small businesses cant afford to hire a full time person for things like managing emails, replying to clients or following up on leads. Karwan AI does all of that automatically. You just tell it what you need and it figures out how to get it done. It doesnt wait, it doesnt take breaks, and it works 24 hours.

This is not a software where you login and click buttons. It is more like having an employee that actually does the work for you, based on what you want to achieve. The difference from other tools is that it is outcome focused, not feature focused.
